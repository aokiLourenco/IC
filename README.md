# Project Name

## Overview
This project includes three main executables, each designed for specific tasks. The tasks are organized under `T1`, `T2`, and `T3`. The executables are currently set up with hard-coded input files.

## How to Build
To build the project, navigate to the `build/` directory and run the following command:

```bash
make
```

This will compile the necessary files, and you’ll be ready to execute the tasks.
How to Run

After building, you can run the executables for each task:

    T1: Executes Task 1
    T2: Executes Task 2
    T3: Executes Task 3

Please note that the executables currently rely on predefined input files, so you cannot provide custom input files at this time.
