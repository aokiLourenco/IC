# Project#01

## Overview
This project includes three main executables, each designed for specific tasks. The tasks are organized under `P1`, `P2`, and `P3`.

## How to Build
To build the project, navigate to the `build/` directory and run the following command:

```bash
cmake ..
make
```

This will compile the necessary files, and you’ll be ready to execute the tasks.
How to Run

After building, you can run the executables for each task:

    ./P1 <file_name> <file_name>
    ./P2: <file_name> <file_name>
    ./P3: <file_name> <file_name>

Note that the second file will not be tested for any other task except the task which needs more than 1 file for execution.
